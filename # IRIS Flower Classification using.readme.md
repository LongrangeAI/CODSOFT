# IRIS Flower Classification using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify different species of the Iris flower based on their physical measurements. The IRIS dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, containing measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** IRIS.csv  
- **Goal:** To classify the species of Iris flower accurately using logistic regression.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Steps:**
  - Data Loading and Exploration
  - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization
  - Feature selection and preparation
  - Model training using logistic regression
  - Model evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
