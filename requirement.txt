# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

A beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts the species of an Iris flower using sepal and petal dimensions. Built using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the **Iris Dataset**, which contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers:

* Iris-setosa
* Iris-versicolor
* Iris-virginica

Each sample contains the following features:

* `sepal length (cm)`
* `sepal width (cm)`
* `petal length (cm)`
* `petal width (cm)`
* `species` (target label)

You can find this dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) or load it via a CSV file named `IRIS.csv`.

## 🔍 Project Objective

The goal is to classify the species of an Iris flower using machine learning based on its sepal and petal dimensions.
This project helps in understanding:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data visualization
* Model building using `Logistic Regression`
* Evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
